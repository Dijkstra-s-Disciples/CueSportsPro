A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
   CueSportsPro is a sophisticated tournament management system with role-based access control for players and 
tournament officials. The platform enables tournament officials to create customizable tournaments 
with different rule sets (8-Ball, 9-Ball, 10-Ball), scoring configurations, and skill-level brackets. Players 
can register for upcoming tournaments, view their match schedules, and track their performance history. When 
tournaments are in session, the system provides real-time bracket visualization with automatic progression 
as officials record match results, creating an engaging and transparent tournament experience for all participants
and spectators.

   Beyond tournament management, CueSportsPro delivers comprehensive player profiles with detailed match histories, 
win/loss statistics, and performance analytics across different rule sets. The platform maintains an archive of past 
tournaments with complete results and winner information for historical reference. Users can customize notification 
preferences to stay informed about tournament registrations, upcoming matches, and results. The elegant user interface, 
featuring subtle animations, textured backgrounds, and carefully crafted typography, ensures an intuitive and visually 
appealing experience across all devices, making CueSportsPro the definitive platform for organizing and participating 
in cue sports competitions.
